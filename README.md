## Getting Started

My application is a hangman game. It is great for when you are bored and need entertainment

To start the game there will be a button where you click start. My application will ask you to enter a word that you want another person to guess. Keep entering a letter until the word is guessed or the hangman is drawn.

It was built by using GUI to implement a hangman drawing, texts, and labels


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
