## Getting Started

My application is a hangman game. It is great for when you are bored and need entertainment

To start the game there will be a button where you click start. My application will ask you to enter a word that you want another person to guess. Keep entering a letter until the word is guessed or the hangman is drawn.

It was built by using GUI to implement a hangman drawing, texts, and labels


## UML Class Diagram

For the UML class diagram, I created a main class and made methods that stored the words, displayed letters and drew the hangman. I used ArrayList, string, int to do this. I made a subclass that starts the game with a button.
